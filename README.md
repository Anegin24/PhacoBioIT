# PhacoBioIT: A scalable workflow solution for analysis and visualization ultra-low coverage NGS data from Pre-implantation genetic testing for aneuploidy.
## Introduction
PhacoBioIT was written by molecular biologist/bioinformatics expert anegin97. PhacoBioIT was created with the hope that other colleagues who are not specialized in using applications that require command line knowledge can perform the PGT-A data analysis process automatically with just the click of a button. The software is deployed as a web application, integrating data visualization tools along with a database to manage sample files.

PhacoBioIT mainly built with python and R, it includes the followings dependencies:
* bwa
* samtools
* zip
* unzip
* cnvkit
* ggplot2
* tidyverse
* dplyr
* shiny
* DT
